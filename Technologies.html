            <!-- what it is -->
            <h3 class="heading-md">What is the Cloud?</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud technology enables the user or users to store and access data, and access programs via the
                internet. Instead of using a computer's local hard drive space, users can always store their data and
                applications on the cloud to be readily accessible. Companies or users alike can rent programs or
                storage from cloud service providers, for companies this can reduce the heavy upfront costs involved
                with owning and maintaining their own IT data infrastructure. Instead they are able to pay for what they
                use and when they use it. The cloud service providers own large data centers which contain a massive
                amount of computer systems and networking equipment; These are used for storing, collecting, processing,
                distributing or allowing access to massive amounts of data. When clients are deciding to move to cloud
                services for their business there are multiple different models available to choose from. The main three
                cloud service models include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>SaaS SaaS (software as a service).</li>
                <li>IaaS (infrastructure as a service).</li>
                <li>PaaS (platform as a service).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each of these individual cloud service models have their own unique benefits to fit the needs that
                different types of businesses and operations require.
            </p>
            <!-- SaaS information -->
            <h3 class="heading-sml">What is SaaS and when to use it</h3>
            <p>Software as a service, commonly shortened to SaaS, is the most commonly utilized cloud model taking
                advantage of the internet to deliver applications to their users. Most of the SaaS applications usually
                run directly through the user's browser; this is quite useful because it requires no downloads and
                installation by the end user. Commonly used SaaS services include google cloud, dropbox and Microsoft
                365. 
            </p>
            <p>
                SaaS platforms are best suited for when you would like your applications to run reliably and without any
                hiccups with minimal input from the user. For example, emailing is a good use of SaaS as businesses and
                individuals alike greatly benefit from being able to send and receive emails without having to worry
                about needing to update or mess with settings. For instance, if you had an email server for your
                business, and it went down because it wasn’t updated correctly it could go down for several days until
                someone came out and fixed it. This could seriously affect the business and is just not an option
                businesses need to be taking in today's market. 
            </p>
            <!-- IaaS information -->
            <h3 class="heading-sml">What is IaaS?</h3>
            <p>
                Infrastructure as a service, commonly shortened to IaaS, allows companies to rent a provision of a
                computer's hardware resources over the internet instead of having to purchase the hardware outright.
                IaaS cloud providers can give companies access to a wide array of infrastructures including, storage,
                networking, servers and other services. Examples of IaaS providers include, Digital Ocean, Amazon web
                services, and Microsoft azure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Infrastructure as a service can be useful to many different types and sizes of businesses; It allows the
                business to have complete control over the infrastructure and works on a pay-as-you-use model which
                allows the service to fit into most budgets. IaaS is great for scaling as it allows you to expand to
                meet your requirements at any time, allowing companies to essentially future proof themselves.
            </p>
            <!-- PaaS Information -->
            <h3 class="heading-sml">What is PaaS?</h3>
            <p>
                Platform as a service, commonly shortened to PaaS, allows developers to rent the tools they need to
                create and deploy applications all completely on the cloud without having to build and maintain the
                complex infrastructure that would normally be involved with building and deploying applications. Common
                examples of PaaS providers include Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Heroku.
            </p>
            <p>
                Platform as a service is most often the most time efficient and cost-effective way for developers to
                create applications. PaaS enables the developers to spend more time focused on the creative side of
                developing apps instead of wasting time on software updates or other menial tasks.
            </p>
            <!-- What is the Impact -->
            <h3 class="heading-md">What is the likely impact of cloud computing?</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud computing is impacting everyone's lives daily whether they realize it or not. In today’s world it’s
                almost a necessity to make use of the technology whether that's for personal reasons or as a business;
                This makes cloud technology one of the most impactful industries in today’s market with “90% of
                companies utilizing the cloud, 60% of workloads being run on the cloud and 30% of IT budgets being
                dedicated to the cloud”(Flexera 2019). Generating an estimated $US249,800,000,000 in revenue a year with
                those numbers only expected to increase in the coming years.
            </p>
            <p>
                With more businesses adopting the use of cloud computing the technology itself continues to evolve
                allowing it to expand into a wider range of uses, For example a technology many companies are now aiming
                to perfect is Gaming as a service(GaaS) with the gaming market predicted to make an estimated $US256.97
                billion in revenue by the year 2025 (Mordor Intelligence 2019). Many businesses see this as an
                opportunity to generate profits via using cloud technology to run video games, requiring no expensive
                hardware to be purchased on the users end, they can simply install applications on their platform of
                choice (usually smartphones or computers) and be able to play the most current games with minimal
                requirements. For example, services like google stadia or PlayStation now currently allow users to play
                video games over the cloud. Among this I believe that cloud technology will heavily impact startups and
                small business with more business adopting the Desktop as a Service (DaaS) model which allows companies
                to utilize the cloud to deliver virtual desktops or virtual machines (VM) which can be accessed via a
                html browser or downloaded to a device for instance, desktops, laptops or tablets can make use of DaaS.
                The use of DaaS offers a pay-as-you-go and allows the business to scale up without the hefty costs
                involved with purchasing computer hardware outright. As Cloud computing evolves, I believe the impact it
                will have on the information technology industry and other businesses alike, will see the industry spend
                less money on hardware components and more spent implementing the cloud into their workspaces.
            </p>
            <!-- The affect -->
            <h3 class="heading-md">How will this affect you?</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud computing will affect me in many ways throughout my personal life and my career. In my personal
                life the cloud affects me daily making use of Google's platforms such as, storing my documents and
                photos via google drive, creating new documents with google docs and google sheets and sending and
                receiving emails via Gmail. Cloud computing will also certainly affect me as someone who enjoys playing
                video games as the Gaming as a service (GaaS) technology evolves it will create opportunities for me to
                experience video games in a completely new way, being able to play games on the go with mobile devices
                or laptops without the need for expensive hardware to make that possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my professional career cloud computing will also affect me in many ways; as someone who has the goal
                of working as a software engineer, I believe that I will be making use of the cloud on almost a daily
                basis. Whether that may be storing and accessing data on the cloud, using email to communicate with
                colleagues or using different cloud service models to create and deploy apps. Useful models like PaaS to
                create applications on the cloud (e.g. google app engine) and utilizing a BaaS (backend as a Service)
                method to manage the behind the scenes aspects involved with app development.

        <h2 class="heading-lg text-center">Report on Cyber Security</h2>
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is Cyber Security?</h3>
        <p>
            Cyber Security is the procedure of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks by
            combining a body of technologies, processes, and practices. There are numerous elements that encompass
            cyber:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Network Security: The process of protecting a network from threats, unwanted access, and intrusions.
            <li>Application Security: Ensuring programs are safe from attacks via updates and testing.
            <li>Endpoint Security: Companies that use remote access need to protect their network in the process.
            <li>Data Security: Business contain and keep valuable information for both themselves and customers in
                networks and applications. It is of upmost importance to keep this data safe.
            <li>Identity Management: The understanding of the level of access each individual is granted in an
                organisation.
            <li>Database and Infrastructure Security: Using the necessary tools to protect the databases and physical
                equipment of the network.
            <li>Cloud Security: Protecting the data that is stored in a complete online environment.
            <li>Mobile Security: Specifically referring to mobile phones and tablets, which can be any number of these
                different elements combined.
            <li>Disaster Recovery: This is the plan in place for the continuity of the business in the event of a data
                breach, natural disaster, or another event where data is in risk.
        </ul>
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is the state of the art of Cyber Security?</h3>
        <p>
            In today’s day and age, IT is continuously evolving and in turn so are cyber threats and security risks. With
            the advancement of technology, organisations have had to shift from the traditional ways of protecting
            against perimeter threats to a more continuous, proactive, and adaptive approach to counteract the level and
            severity of cyber threats.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Every year, organisations lose billions of pounds to cybercrime – and it’s a persistent and worsening
            problem.” [Victor Victories, 2020].
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the worsening problem of cybercrime, the cyber-defence industry has had to look for new ways to combat
            these threats. The continuous search to find more effective means has resulted in some ground-breaking
            defence technologies:
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-sml">
            Moving Target Security
        </h3>
        <p>An Israeli company by the name of Morphisec has developed a method of cyber defence which effectively
            scrambles details to prevent and deter malware from infecting a system. This is done by scrambling the
            names, references, locations of files, as well as the application itself in the server’s memory. On top of
            this, whenever the computer is booted up the details are re-scrambled once again, ensuring the system does
            not repeat the same configuration. [6]</p>
        <h3 class="heading-sml">
            Air Gapping
        </h3>
        <p>Air gapping is a technique in which a system is isolated from local networks and the internet. When a system
            is air gapped, the only way it can be compromised from hacking is by physical access to the server itself.
            This is an effective method of security for highly sensitive data and critical systems. However, even though
            it is a good countermeasure against outside threats, there are still potential security issues such as air
            gapped servers being altered or modified prior to installation. [7]</p>
        <h3 class="heading-sml">
            Cooperative Cybersecurity
        </h3>
        <p>As organisations grow larger, their data becomes more valuable. In turn, to protect their data they can form
            a data-sharing alliance to store each other’s data. As data is encoded into thousands of numbers, this
            method effectively disperses them randomly to the computers within the participating organisations. As this
            data is encrypted, for a hacker to steal this data they would need to not only hack one organization, but
            all of them collectively. Not only this, but they would also need to unencrypt the data itself. [8]
        <h3 class="heading-sml">
            Next-Gen Firewalls
        </h3>
        <p>Currently, all computers have in-built firewalls to protect their data. Firewalls are an effective method of
            data security if they are built well. A company by the name of Fortinet have built FortiGate, a next-gen
            firewall to protect websites and web apps from virus, ransomware, and malware infections all the while
            preventing intrusions from cyber threats and blocking distributed denial of service attacks. This next-gen
            firewall is designed to keep the most critical applications secure. To do this, the FortiGate’s threat
            intelligence is continuously updated in order to provide vigorous protection from attacks. [9]</p>
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>In the coming years it may be possible to create a computer that is so well protected that it becomes
            un-hackable, however the process of doing so would render it almost useless in a network environment. No
            matter the protection, there will always be a risk involved when using a network. Security companies are
            continuously looking at new and more sophisticated ways to protect data from cyber threats. As the age of IT
            continues to grow and develop, as does the methods of protection but in turn so does the tools of
            cyber-attacks. Cybercriminals are now using tools such as artificial intelligence, and processes of hiding
            malicious code in encrypted files. Having a safe network and computer whether at work or at home is becoming
            harder every day. [12]</p>
        <p>As it stands, our society fundamentally is more technologically reliant than ever, and there is no clear
            indicator of when this trend will slow. Social media websites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have our
            information mostly publicly available; information that could be maliciously used for identity theft. Cloud
            storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive store sensitive and valuable data like credit
            card information and bank account details.</p>
        <p>Since our society is on a path to technological advancement, the increased use of technology and the internet
            also lead to the increase in cybercrime. With the data that we store online, cybercriminals are becoming
            more sophisticated with increase in attacks with ransomware, phishing, and spyware.</p>
        <h3 class="heading-md">How will this affect you?</h3>
        <p>The development in cyber-security technologies will be most beneficial for organisations, as they contain the
            most valuable data. When it comes to computers used for personal use in day-to-day life, a more personalized
            approach needs to be developed. Most households will not have access to next-gen cyber security
            technologies.</p>
        <p>According to Statisa 4.57 billion people were active internet users as of July 2020, encompassing 59 percent
            of the human population. More than half of the planet use internet in their day-to-day lives. Of those 4.57
            billion people, 2.6 billion use Facebook; that is a third of the human population who make their information
            publicly available. There have been countless data breaches where the information of consumers has been
            obtained by cybercriminals, information such as phone numbers, passwords, e-mail addresses, IP addresses,
            names, dates of birth, bank details, and credit card information. Even with the advancements in
            cyber-security, these breaches do and will continue to happen. [13] [14]</p>
        <p>Cyber-defence industry is continuously evolving to combat these threats. As technology becomes more important
            and integrated in our lives, it leads us to become increasingly dependent on it. It certainly makes life
            easier, but also allows vulnerabilities to risk. As breaches in cyber-security can be catastrophic for not
            only organisations but also individuals, these advancements will put safeguards in place to protect our
            wealth, health, and livelihood. This will help the population become more aware of cyber threats, and how to
            defend themselves. Another benefit to the improvements of cyber-security is that it embeds awareness
            training and risk mitigation into our everyday lives. Awareness and risk mitigation coupled with advanced
            cyber-security will result in a safe online environment and the gradual decrease in cybercrime.</p>
