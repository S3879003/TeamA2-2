            <!-- what it is -->
            <h3 class="heading-md">What is the Cloud?</h3>

            <p>
                Cloud technology enables the user or users to store and access data, and access programs via the
                internet. Instead of using a computer's local hard drive space, users can always store their data and
                applications on the cloud to be readily accessible. Companies or users alike can rent programs or
                storage from cloud service providers, for companies this can reduce the heavy upfront costs involved
                with owning and maintaining their own IT data infrastructure. Instead they are able to pay for what they
                use and when they use it. The cloud service providers own large data centers which contain a massive
                amount of computer systems and networking equipment; These are used for storing, collecting, processing,
                distributing or allowing access to massive amounts of data. When clients are deciding to move to cloud
                services for their business there are multiple different models available to choose from. The main three
                cloud service models include:
            </p>
            <ul class="">
                <li>SaaS SaaS (software as a service).</li>
                <li>IaaS (infrastructure as a service).</li>
                <li>PaaS (platform as a service).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each of these individual cloud service models have their own unique benefits to fit the needs that
                different types of businesses and operations require.
            </p>
            <!-- SaaS information -->
            <h3 class="heading-sml">What is SaaS and when to use it</h3>
            <p>Software as a service, commonly shortened to SaaS, is the most commonly utilized cloud model taking
                advantage of the internet to deliver applications to their users. Most of the SaaS applications usually
                run directly through the user's browser; this is quite useful because it requires no downloads and
                installation by the end user. Commonly used SaaS services include google cloud, dropbox and Microsoft
                365.
            </p>
            <p>
                SaaS platforms are best suited for when you would like your applications to run reliably and without any
                hiccups with minimal input from the user. For example, emailing is a good use of SaaS as businesses and
                individuals alike greatly benefit from being able to send and receive emails without having to worry
                about needing to update or mess with settings. For instance, if you had an email server for your
                business, and it went down because it wasn’t updated correctly it could go down for several days until
                someone came out and fixed it. This could seriously affect the business and is just not an option
                businesses need to be taking in today's market.
            </p>
            <!-- IaaS information -->
            <h3 class="heading-sml">What is IaaS?</h3>
            <p>
                Infrastructure as a service, commonly shortened to IaaS, allows companies to rent a provision of a
                computer's hardware resources over the internet instead of having to purchase the hardware outright.
                IaaS cloud providers can give companies access to a wide array of infrastructures including, storage,
                networking, servers and other services. Examples of IaaS providers include, Digital Ocean, Amazon web
                services, and Microsoft azure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Infrastructure as a service can be useful to many different types and sizes of businesses; It allows the
                business to have complete control over the infrastructure and works on a pay-as-you-use model which
                allows the service to fit into most budgets. IaaS is great for scaling as it allows you to expand to
                meet your requirements at any time, allowing companies to essentially future proof themselves.
            </p>
            <!-- PaaS Information -->
            <h3 class="heading-sml">What is PaaS?</h3>
            <p>
                Platform as a service, commonly shortened to PaaS, allows developers to rent the tools they need to
                create and deploy applications all completely on the cloud without having to build and maintain the
                complex infrastructure that would normally be involved with building and deploying applications. Common
                examples of PaaS providers include Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Heroku.
            </p>
            <p>
                Platform as a service is most often the most time efficient and cost-effective way for developers to
                create applications. PaaS enables the developers to spend more time focused on the creative side of
                developing apps instead of wasting time on software updates or other menial tasks.
            </p>
            <!-- What is the Impact -->
            <h3 class="heading-md">What is the likely impact of cloud computing?</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud computing is impacting everyone's lives daily whether they realize it or not. In today’s world it’s
                almost a necessity to make use of the technology whether that's for personal reasons or as a business;
                This makes cloud technology one of the most impactful industries in today’s market with “90% of
                companies utilizing the cloud, 60% of workloads being run on the cloud and 30% of IT budgets being
                dedicated to the cloud”(Flexera 2019). Generating an estimated $US249,800,000,000 in revenue a year with
                those numbers only expected to increase in the coming years (Flexera 2019).
            </p>
            <p>
                With more businesses adopting the use of cloud computing the technology itself continues to evolve
                allowing it to expand into a wider range of uses, For example a technology many companies are now aiming
                to perfect is Gaming as a service(GaaS) with the gaming market predicted to make an estimated $US256.97
                billion in revenue by the year 2025 (Mordor Intelligence 2019). Many businesses see this as an
                opportunity to generate profits via using cloud technology to run video games, requiring no expensive
                hardware to be purchased on the users end, they can simply install applications on their platform of
                choice (usually smartphones or computers) and be able to play the most current games with minimal
                requirements. For example, services like google stadia or PlayStation now currently allow users to play
                video games over the cloud. Among this I believe that cloud technology will heavily impact startups and
                small business with more business adopting the Desktop as a Service (DaaS) model which allows companies
                to utilize the cloud to deliver virtual desktops or virtual machines (VM) which can be accessed via a
                html browser or downloaded to a device for instance, desktops, laptops or tablets can make use of DaaS.
                The use of DaaS offers a pay-as-you-go and allows the business to scale up without the hefty costs
                involved with purchasing computer hardware outright. As Cloud computing evolves, I believe the impact it
                will have on the information technology industry and other businesses alike, will see the industry spend
                less money on hardware components and more spent implementing the cloud into their workspaces.
            </p>
            <!-- The affect -->
            <h3 class="heading-md">How will this affect you?</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud computing will affect me in many ways throughout my personal life and my career. In my personal
                life the cloud affects me daily making use of Google's platforms such as, storing my documents and
                photos via google drive, creating new documents with google docs and google sheets and sending and
                receiving emails via Gmail. Cloud computing will also certainly affect me as someone who enjoys playing
                video games as the Gaming as a service (GaaS) technology evolves it will create opportunities for me to
                experience video games in a completely new way, being able to play games on the go with mobile devices
                or laptops without the need for expensive hardware to make that possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my professional career cloud computing will also affect me in many ways; as someone who has the goal
                of working as a software engineer, I believe that I will be making use of the cloud on almost a daily
                basis. Whether that may be storing and accessing data on the cloud, using email to communicate with
                colleagues or using different cloud service models to create and deploy apps. Useful models like PaaS to
                create applications on the cloud (e.g. google app engine) and utilizing a BaaS (backend as a Service)
                method to manage the behind the scenes aspects involved with app development.

        <h2 class="heading-lg text-center">Report on Cyber Security</h2>
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is Cyber Security?</h3>
        <p>
            Cyber Security is the procedure of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks by
            combining a body of technologies, processes, and practices. There are numerous elements that encompass
            cyber:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Network Security: The process of protecting a network from threats, unwanted access, and intrusions.
            <li>Application Security: Ensuring programs are safe from attacks via updates and testing.
            <li>Endpoint Security: Companies that use remote access need to protect their network in the process.
            <li>Data Security: Business contain and keep valuable information for both themselves and customers in
                networks and applications. It is of upmost importance to keep this data safe.
            <li>Identity Management: The understanding of the level of access each individual is granted in an
                organisation.
            <li>Database and Infrastructure Security: Using the necessary tools to protect the databases and physical
                equipment of the network.
            <li>Cloud Security: Protecting the data that is stored in a complete online environment.
            <li>Mobile Security: Specifically referring to mobile phones and tablets, which can be any number of these
                different elements combined.
            <li>Disaster Recovery: This is the plan in place for the continuity of the business in the event of a data
                breach, natural disaster, or another event where data is in risk.
        </ul>
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is the state of the art of Cyber Security?</h3>
        <p>
            In today’s day and age, IT is continuously evolving and in turn so are cyber threats and security risks. With
            the advancement of technology, organisations have had to shift from the traditional ways of protecting
            against perimeter threats to a more continuous, proactive, and adaptive approach to counteract the level and
            severity of cyber threats.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Every year, organisations lose billions of pounds to cybercrime – and it’s a persistent and worsening
            problem.” [Victor Victories, 2020]
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the worsening problem of cybercrime, the cyber-defence industry has had to look for new ways to combat
            these threats. The continuous search to find more effective means has resulted in some ground-breaking
            defence technologies:
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-sml">
            Moving Target Security
        </h3>
        <p>An Israeli company by the name of Morphisec has developed a method of cyber defence which effectively
            scrambles details to prevent and deter malware from infecting a system. This is done by scrambling the
            names, references, locations of files, as well as the application itself in the server’s memory. On top of
            this, whenever the computer is booted up the details are re-scrambled once again, ensuring the system does
            not repeat the same configuration. [M. Torquato and M. Vieira, 2020]</p>
        <h3 class="heading-sml">
            Air Gapping
        </h3>
        <p>Air gapping is a technique in which a system is isolated from local networks and the internet. When a system
            is air gapped, the only way it can be compromised from hacking is by physical access to the server itself.
            This is an effective method of security for highly sensitive data and critical systems. However, even though
            it is a good countermeasure against outside threats, there are still potential security issues such as air
            gapped servers being altered or modified prior to installation. [G. DiFazio, 2020]</p>
        <h3 class="heading-sml">
            Cooperative Cybersecurity
        </h3>
        <p>As organisations grow larger, their data becomes more valuable. In turn, to protect their data they can form
            a data-sharing alliance to store each other’s data. As data is encoded into thousands of numbers, this
            method effectively disperses them randomly to the computers within the participating organisations. As this
            data is encrypted, for a hacker to steal this data they would need to not only hack one organization, but
            all of them collectively. Not only this, but they would also need to unencrypt the data itself. [Cybersecuritycrc.org.au, 2020]
        <h3 class="heading-sml">Next-Gen Firewalls</h3>
        <p>Currently, all computers have in-built firewalls to protect their data. Firewalls are an effective method of
            data security if they are built well. A company by the name of Fortinet have built FortiGate, a next-gen
            firewall to protect websites and web apps from virus, ransomware, and malware infections all the while
            preventing intrusions from cyber threats and blocking distributed denial of service attacks. This next-gen
            firewall is designed to keep the most critical applications secure. To do this, the FortiGate’s threat
            intelligence is continuously updated in order to provide vigorous protection from attacks. [Fortinet, 2020]</p>
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>In the coming years it may be possible to create a computer that is so well protected that it becomes
            un-hackable, however the process of doing so would render it almost useless in a network environment. No
            matter the protection, there will always be a risk involved when using a network. Security companies are
            continuously looking at new and more sophisticated ways to protect data from cyber threats. As the age of IT
            continues to grow and develop, as does the methods of protection but in turn so does the tools of
            cyber-attacks. Cybercriminals are now using tools such as artificial intelligence, and processes of hiding
            malicious code in encrypted files. Having a safe network and computer whether at work or at home is becoming
            harder every day. [Upguard.com, 2020]</p>
        <p>As it stands, our society fundamentally is more technologically reliant than ever, and there is no clear
            indicator of when this trend will slow. Social media websites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have our
            information mostly publicly available; information that could be maliciously used for identity theft. Cloud
            storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive store sensitive and valuable data like credit
            card information and bank account details.</p>
        <p>Since our society is on a path to technological advancement, the increased use of technology and the internet
            also lead to the increase in cybercrime. With the data that we store online, cybercriminals are becoming
            more sophisticated with increase in attacks with ransomware, phishing, and spyware.</p>
        <h3 class="heading-md">How will this affect you?</h3>
        <p>The development in cyber-security technologies will be most beneficial for organisations, as they contain the
            most valuable data. When it comes to computers used for personal use in day-to-day life, a more personalized
            approach needs to be developed. Most households will not have access to next-gen cyber security
            technologies.</p>
        <p>According to Statisa 4.57 billion people were active internet users as of July 2020, encompassing 59 percent
            of the human population. More than half of the planet use internet in their day-to-day lives. Of those 4.57
            billion people, 2.6 billion use Facebook; that is a third of the human population who make their information
            publicly available. There have been countless data breaches where the information of consumers has been
            obtained by cybercriminals, information such as phone numbers, passwords, e-mail addresses, IP addresses,
            names, dates of birth, bank details, and credit card information. Even with the advancements in
            cyber-security, these breaches do and will continue to happen. [Statista, 2020]</p>
        <p>Cyber-defence industry is continuously evolving to combat these threats. As technology becomes more important
            and integrated in our lives, it leads us to become increasingly dependent on it. It certainly makes life
            easier, but also allows vulnerabilities to risk. As breaches in cyber-security can be catastrophic for not
            only organisations but also individuals, these advancements will put safeguards in place to protect our
            wealth, health, and livelihood. This will help the population become more aware of cyber threats, and how to
            defend themselves. Another benefit to the improvements of cyber-security is that it embeds awareness
            training and risk mitigation into our everyday lives. Awareness and risk mitigation coupled with advanced
            cyber-security will result in a safe online environment and the gradual decrease in cybercrime.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-lg text-center">Report on Machine Learning </h2>
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is Machine learning?</h3>
        <p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence which is aimed to be able to learn itself from inputted data and predict outcomes without being programmed by a human. Traditionally, humans analyzed data and adapted the system to the changes in data patterns. However, as the larger volume of data surpasses the ability of humans to make sense of it and write rules manually, humans have turned to automated systems that can learn from the data and more importantly, adapt to the changes in data to provide a comprehensible result. IT professionals like software engineers are inclined to think logically and mathematically when it comes to determining an outcome of a certain event or a program, with machine learning, the method shifts from a mathematical science to natural science: making observations of an unpredictable world, running experiments and analyzing statistics to determine a conclusion (Norvig, 2020).</p>
        <p>There are two types of learning techniques that Machine learning uses: supervised learning, which trains a model on labeled data, in other words, known input and output data, and uses it to predict future outputs. The second is unsupervised learning, which finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data (au.mathworks.com, 2020).</p>
        <p>Machine learning is implemented in numerous areas, here are a few examples of what it is currently being used for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Virtual Personal Assistants:
              <br>Whether it be Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, or even Bixby, all these virtual assistants use machine learning as they collect and analyze the information based on your previous interaction with them. Later, this set of data is used to extract outcomes that are personalized to your preferences.</br>
            <li>Product Recommendations:
              <br>When someone searches for a product or service online, they start receiving emails and social media advertisements for the same product or similar items which may be of interest to the customer. This is the work of machine learning as it advertises similar product recommendations based on your web browsing behavior, past purchases, and in general things that a user may have clicked on or added to cart.</br>
            <li>Fraud Detection:
              <br>Many organizations use rule-based systems to detect fraud. Rule-based systems can quickly and accurately notice known patterns. However, rules are not at all effective at recognizing unknown schemes, learning new fraud patterns, or managing sophisticated techniques used by fraudsters. Here, fraud analytics, powered by machine learning, becomes necessary for fraud prevention and detection (SAS.com, 2020).
            </br>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading-md">What is State-of-the-art in Machine Learning?</h3>
        <p>Machine learning’s latest and most compelling developments are seen in the healthcare system. From the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases to the development of medication and epidemiology, Machine learning has significant potential to revolutionize the medical industry. The increase in knowledge and understanding of diseases has led to the growth in information and data. Such a big data bank is now be being used for the application of machine learning. An example of this is Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), Machine learning in CMR can assist clinicians and engineers in improving imaging quality, image analysis, and interpretation, as well as patient evaluation. This is done by extracting important characteristics or features from images by using a designed feature set. In this case, features may include image contrast, noise characteristics, texture, and motion. In the training phase, the parameters of the feature set model are learned. A model is any function of the features used for prediction and the parameters of the model dictate the actual predictions made. Once trained, the model can be used to predict data not seen previously in the training phase. ML models can then predict the presence or absence of disease (Leiner, T., Rueckert, D., Suinesiaputra, A, 2019).
        </p>
          <h3 class="heading-md">Future of Machine learning:</h3>
          <p>Today there exists supervised Machine learning in which labels need to be provided for the machine to learn, however going into the future it is much more likely that only unsupervised algorithms will exist and produce much more accurate results. Neural networks (replicating the process of real neurons in our brain) are fundamental for breakthroughs in machine learning, this is called Deep Learning. A future application of Machine learning and its subset Deep learning is currently being developed by companies like Apple, Tesla, and Nissan in the form of Autonomous cars or self-driving vehicles. One of the main tasks of the machine learning algorithm in the self-driving car is a continuous rendering of the surrounding environment and the prediction of possible changes to those surroundings. These tasks are mainly divided into four sub-tasks, object detection, object Identification, object localization, and prediction of movement (MQTT et al., 2020).</p>
          <h3 class="heading-md">Impact of Machine learning:</h3>
          <p>Machine learning systems are growing more popular and better with experience. Just as electricity and steam engines had transformed the world, machine learning systems are poised to do the same. They can do numerous amounts of tasks much more effectively and efficiently than humans; they can also detect many complex observations that seem invisible to the human mind. However, they are unlikely to replace people in all jobs. Earlier this year, for instance, researchers showed that a Machine learning program could detect skin cancers better than a dermatologist. That doesn’t mean it will replace dermatologists, who do many things other than evaluate lesions. For tasks that are already online, Machine learning can be immensely productive. Jobs that don’t require dexterity, physical skills, or mobility are much more suitable for Machine learning. Tasks that involve making quick decisions based on data is what Machine learning programs are designed for; not so if the decision depends on long chains of reasoning, diverse background knowledge, or common sense. Machine learning is not suitable for detailed explanations and reasoning behind how a decision was made. For instance, Machine learning might be producing a more accurate result and faster than a physician at detecting skin cancers, but a dermatologist is better at explaining why a lesion is cancerous or not (sciencedaily.com, 2020). It may be very evident that technologies like Machine learning and Artificial intelligence are replacing the human workforce such as Google, who in 2014 Google was valued at $370 billion with only 55,000 employees, a tenth the size of AT&T’s workforce in the 1960s, yet workers will have to perform new tasks or be reskilled as tasks become automated, leading to millions of new jobs. As businesses embrace AI, robots, machine learning, and deep learning, they will need a clear strategy for using technology without creating fear around the displacement of jobs.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-md">How does Machine learning impact you?</h3>
          <p>There are countless ways in which Machine learning is being implemented and used throughout our lives. Of course, there are common and well-known methods such as the ones I listed above like virtual personal assistants, personalized marketing, and fraud detection, but there are still many more that have more impact on our lives than we realize.</p>
          <p><br><b>Intelligent Gaming:</b></br>
            Google's DeepMind's AlphaGo defeated Go world champion, Lee Sedol. Go is a much more difficult game to master than Chess, however, AlphaGo was specifically trained to play Go, not only by replicating moves of the best players but more so by learning to play better from practicing against itself millions of times (elitedatascience.com,2020). Just like this example Machine learning is used in many games to create complex and difficult opposing AI bots to enhance a gamer’s experience.
          </p>
          <p><br><b>Personalized Digital Media:</b></br>
            Machine learning is heavily used in the entertainment industry. Streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play, and Spotify. Algorithms are also used to remove buffering and low-quality playback, getting users the best quality regardless of the internet service provider. Machine learning algorithms record and store vast amounts of data about consumers’ viewing habits, helping streaming services offer more useful recommendations (elitedatascience.com,2020).
          </p>
          <p>"Given the rapid pace of research, I expect AI to be able to create new personalized media, such as music according to your taste. Imagine a future music service that doesn't just play existing songs you might like, but continually generates new songs just for you."
          <br>— Jan Kautz, Senior Director of Visual Computing and Machine Learning Research, NVIDIA</br>
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-md">Conclusion:</h3>
          <p>Since the earliest days of computing, Artificial intelligence has been implemented and developed. Pioneers always want to make machines smarter and more intelligent as time goes on and we discover extraordinary technologies. Machine learning is currently the most promising aspect of Artificial Intelligence. Instead of encoding machines with everything task, they must perform and carry out, Machine learning enables them to learn, and then to learn again on how to learn, this is the fundamental process which is revolutionizing all of our lives.

        <p> It was 12 years ago on October 31, the same day as Halloween, a disruptive innovate paper that ushered a change in the landscape of how we would look at transactions forever was published. The paper was titled “Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System” and the man person who propose this concept went by a pseudonym by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto and to this day remains unidentified. In their work, they introduce a P2P electronic system which brought to the cryptographic community and the rest of the world a solution to an existing problem. We will be exploring the concepts where they were the brainchild behind and concepts, they integrated together to form their paper, for theory and implementation and use case in terms of its application. It is once we do this that we can have a greater appreciation of the ideas brought for all of us to benefit from Satoshi’s invention, but outside of his vision and separate it as such. At the same time explaining to you all why their design attempt for a better humanity cannot work, in the way in which they described.

          <br><b>The Dot Com Beast:</b></br>
          The internet had a lot of momentum during the period from late 1995 up to the early 2000’s, a time known as the Dot Com bubble. Where the way of life for tech companies and online business owners seemed like a dream of prosperity coming true. This was because starting at the latter part of the 1990’s was what people deemed as the “new economy” and it was fueled by the growth in the stock market coming from venture capitalist and IPO (Initial Public Offering) based companies in the online, ecommerce and technology sectors. Yet the dark cloud was looming and as Rome did not fall in a day, so also did not the illusion of this new economy. Yet in one fateful swoop, on March 11th, 2000, the beast took a lot of victims by surprise to their impending doom, as it devoured much of the “new economy.” Like Rome those who took part in the “new economy” were lulled into a state of false security and then sudden destruction came and their fate was sealed in stone.
        </p>
        <p>What went wrong was that at face value they did not take the beast seriously and fell for its appeal to promise those who partake in this venture wealth and prosperity. Behind it all was misleading calculations and speculations which they fell for without digging through the deception to find the truth. Because they gave an overvaluation towards the true worth of the stock, did not see difficulty of the valuation, and did not see that the online sector was in its infancy though there was a promise of high potential returns, it was also considered as a high risk. Therefore, so many went out of business and lost a lot of money. Also, because the flow of money coming in for the supply and demand on those sectors was only more on the investment end, but not so much for the consumer side. It also lacked resources in terms to scale the businesses and that did not help either. These were the reasons why the beast bursting the bubble was so effective. Yet unlike the recession of the Great Depression of October 24, 1929; Black Thursday, the Dot Com beast was a beast of a smaller strength and power. The difference was that the Great Depression had a greater global impact on economies on a macrocosmic scale, the dot com beast impacted though globally, it was global with a lesser microcosmic reach. This was because it targeted the technology and online sector, who was still maturing concerning the realms of e-commerce. Another part where it differed was in terms of the duration of the recessions. For the Great Depression it lasted a total of 10 years, while the dot com bubble burst lasted for 2 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this, it was the investment made to the tech companies and the online sector for the periods before the Dot Com beast, in the age of the Internet which helped the internet to mature like a tree. As the result of this maturity, the internet had a chance to gain more economic significance and was provided the infrastructure it needed to live another day and scale outwards and reach a wider audience world-wide. The dot com beasts faded away, but the internet stayed strong and the minute number of companies of the greater whole which managed to survive, became bigger and stronger than ever. Those were Google, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Oracle, Amazon, eBay etc. Because of this the internet further developed deeper roots (stronger foundation) and more branches (further outreach), to where it could bloom and flourish like it should.

        <h3 class="heading-md">What is the impact of Cryptocurrency?</h3>
        <p>
          <b><br>“New economy” and the human utopia problem:</bd></b>
          However, there was a problem that was faced, and it was not addressed in the prior “new economy” and yet was waiting to be addressed. In all this time for such a new economy to exist, there must be a different system of governance over money and how it is managed and how to decrease the chances of fraud. It is especially important for a true new economy to not reflect the old-world style- before the dot com burst. Anything that stopped governments from having total power is always good for everyone and is one step further from the Orwellian nightmare. At the same time, by doing so, it will end up leading to another nightmare of human utopia, which throughout history proves itself to cause utter failure and anarchy. All the government must do is hire people to form the consensus of the block chain by hiring people to pretend to be individuals and take power still that way. To control the populous, they could also try to sway everyone to come to their consensus by hiring key influential people to propagate their message and the masses will follow. After all, one haunting quote is true, “Democracy is the road to socialism” - Karl Marx.
         </p>
         <p>
           Therefore, if we applied Satoshi P2P electronic cash system for a better society, it could never work seeing what we have presented to everyone so far. Both wanted to create a “new economy,” both did not do their research outside the technical development and both would have had people who believed in the greater good but did not see the beast they were about to create. You see someone can have the right intent, but their creation can be what ends up a living nightmare. There is a famous expression, and it goes like this. “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.” In any case a system should never be looked upon as ruled more “by the people vs by government,” but that they are both a people-based system that is either structured or unstructured. Because a government has people and they have an agreed guideline of conduct for themselves, while an unstructured people-based system looks upon everyone to decide what they think is the best way to go about it. But if a structured or unstructured people-based system faces corruption it would engender anarchy quickly.
         </p>
         <p>
           If the NWO with a centralized global system ever came to be, or Satoshi’s vision of a global decentralized system took into full effect, the results of which would lead to a disaster eventually. Both the NWO and Satoshi’s vision also present a message of peace, safety, and prosperity. Yet the ultimate undeniable truth is this. Not everyone cares about the well-being of others or want to share the same vision. Some in our culture are extremely selfish and self-centered and they are enveloped in their pride and ego, while loving to draw attention to themselves. At the height of it, those people feel it is compulsory for others to look upon them as the center of attention. Thus, showing even more why human utopia is a logical fallacy. With that said, if we focus however more on outside of Satoshi’s vision, on the idea of a cryptocurrency, and block chain technology, then the ideas are remarkably interesting and worth talking about.

         <b><br>Blind Signatures:</br></b>
         In the early 80’s namely the year 1982, a cryptographer by the name of David Chaum with a PhD in Computer science from UC Berkley published a paper called “Blind Signatures for untraceable payments.” In this paper he promotes what was at that time a new cryptosystem which tried to address the following problem. One was the stopping of third parties of the individuals from being able to view their transaction history and record without their consent. The second was to solve a problem that physical money had. Problems such detecting if the individual doing the payment, is the actual individual or an imposter trying to commit fraud. Therefore, as a solution to this problem he introduced the concept which became known as blind signatures and he goes off an explains it using the example of the trustee and the elector. We are going to use Cyber security’s Alice and Bob. Alice writes up a letter and puts it inside of an envelope. This envelop does not display the contents inside, but it is for Bob to sign. When Alice is ready, she sends Bob the envelop. Bob signs the envelop with his signature and sends it back to Alice. Bob the whole time does not also know the contents of which he is signing for; hence the term blind signature because he is blind signing. When he is ready and had signed his signature on the envelop, he sends it back to Alice. The benefit of this that so the contents of Alice’s envelope remains anonymous and she got the signature that she needed. From this idea David then went on to develop a working digital currency Digicash in 1989.

         <p><b><br>Nick Szabo and Bitgold(1998):</br></b>
           In 1998 the man who became known as one of the pioneers of blockchain technology created the Bitgold digital currency. As the result he brought to the world three important concepts to further the development of the digital currency. These concepts are as the following. The first idea is called de-centralized currency. The second idea was proof of work. The last idea it put forward was called smart contracts. The thing about his Bitgold project was that the implementation of the concepts never saw the light of day until Satoshi published his paper on the Bitcoin. Therefore, Satoshi’s implementation is a reflection on what Nick wanted to accomplish.

         <p><b><br>Bitcoins, Hcash and the post quantum world </br></b>
           The next iterative stage for the roadmap of the development of the cryptocurrency, though it’s still in its infancy is technology that emerged called Hcash. It was founded by Dallas Brooks and Khal Achkar in 2016, with its headquarters closer to home in the Asia-Pacific region, namely headquartered here in Melbourne Victoria. Since its founding, the company has reached 53,000,000 from funding by enabling themselves to be an ICO-initial coin offering. The aim of the project was to address an existing issue of what could call stagnation in the flow of interchange between block chain-based systems and block less based systems that utilizes DAG (Direct, Acyclic Graphs). Up to that point, though trading goes on without restrictions on certain centralized exchange platforms, the tokens underlying the systems have structural differences, and therefore rendering them to be only usable in their own blockchain ecosystem. So, their proposed solution to resolve those issues was to create a new cryptocurrency. It was a decentralized and distributed ledger system interconnecting blockchain based and non-blockchain based systems to each other. Doing so promotes limitless information exchange potential as we can imagine between those systems and provides the cryptocurrency community added value. At the helm academically alone in Australia leading the research, development, and implementation- let alone their international partners in academia are the University of technology Sydney, Macquarie University, and Monash University.

         <h3 class="heading-md">Conclusion:</h3>
         <p>
           Though a human based utopia is an interesting concept, it is only as good as the variants of its theories on paper. No system of enhancement via technology created by human’s can ever constitute a system that can be considered as a perfect system, in an imperfect world where certain number of people are egotistical and self-centric by their very nature. Most people try to invent some form of new way money is to be represented and managed to create this Utopia, will only themselves become the new government. As you know some also fear the government and thus it can be stated that they can also become that which they fear. They inadvertently are not fixing anything they set out to do because their viewpoint is over the matter lacks enlightenment. This in the paper represents Satoshi, his contemporaries, and the wider community. We talked about how it is not the people vs the government, but both systems are people based. It is either if you want it a structured way or a non-structured way. And we hope you we all together do not attempt to create such systems because we would be enabling the continuing to phrase “history repeats itself” to remain true on this basis. With that being said, we also looked at the theory and application of the technologies outside of the Satoshi and his contemporaries' vision and the interesting proposal to what it yields. We have investigated various developments to give an insight of what lead to the first cryptocurrency, so you can discover what led to the development of the Bitcoin and the blockchain. We also looked at the future direction of blockchains, Bitcoins and the rise of HCash as a central hub and side chain for interoperability between blockless and blockchain based systems. Doing so advances the online cryptocurrency ecosystem and helps it propel it forward, while giving It more of a chance to monetary value and growth in the future.
