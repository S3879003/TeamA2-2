        <h1 class="heading-lg text-center">Report on Cloud Technology</h2>
        <!-- what it is -->
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is the Cloud?</h3>
        <p>Cloud technology enables the user or users to store and access data, and access programs via the internet. Instead of using a computer's local hard drive space, users can always store their data and applications on the cloud to be readily accessible. Companies or users alike can rent programs or storage from cloud service providers, for companies this can reduce the heavy upfront costs involved with owning and maintaining their own IT data infrastructure. Instead they are able to pay for what they use and when they use it. The cloud service providers own large data centers which contain a massive amount of computer systems and networking equipment; These are used for storing, collecting, processing, distributing or allowing access to massive amounts of data. When clients are deciding to move to cloud services for their business there are multiple different models available to choose from. The main three cloud service models include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>SaaS SaaS (software as a service).</li>
            <li>IaaS (infrastructure as a service).</li>
            <li>PaaS (platform as a service).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each of these individual cloud service models have their own unique benefits to fit the needs that different types of businesses and operations require.</p>
            <!-- SaaS information -->
            <h3 class="heading-sml">What is SaaS and when to use it</h3>
            <p>Software as a service, commonly shortened to SaaS, is the most commonly utilized cloud model taking advantage of the internet to deliver applications to their users. Most of the SaaS applications usually run directly through the user's browser; this is quite useful because it requires no downloads and installation by the end user. Commonly used SaaS services include google cloud, dropbox and Microsoft 365. </p>
            <p>SaaS platforms are best suited for when you would like your applications to run reliably and without any hiccups with minimal input from the user. For example, emailing is a good use of SaaS as businesses and individuals alike greatly benefit from being able to send and receive emails without having to worry about needing to update or mess with settings. For instance, if you had an email server for your business, and it went down because it wasn’t updated correctly it could go down for several days until someone came out and fixed it. This could seriously affect the business and is just not an option businesses need to be taking in today's market. </p>
            <!-- IaaS information -->
            <h3 class="heading-sml">What is IaaS?</h3>
            <p>Infrastructure as a service, commonly shortened to IaaS, allows companies to rent a provision of a computer's hardware resources over the internet instead of having to purchase the hardware outright. IaaS cloud providers can give companies access to a wide array of infrastructures including, storage, networking, servers and other services. Examples of IaaS providers include, Digital Ocean, Amazon web services, and Microsoft azure. </p>
            <p>Infrastructure as a service can be useful to many different types and sizes of businesses; It allows the business to have complete control over the infrastructure and works on a pay-as-you-use model which allows the service to fit into most budgets. IaaS is great for scaling as it allows you to expand to meet your requirements at any time, allowing companies to essentially future proof themselves. </p>
            <!-- PaaS Information -->
            <h3 class="heading-sml">What is PaaS?</h3>
            <p>Platform as a service, commonly shortened to PaaS, allows developers to rent the tools they need to create and deploy applications all completely on the cloud without having to build and maintain the complex infrastructure that would normally be involved with building and deploying applications. Common examples of PaaS providers include Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Heroku. </p>
            <p>Platform as a service is most often the most time efficient and cost-effective way for developers to create applications. PaaS enables the developers to spend more time focused on the creative side of developing apps instead of wasting time on software updates or other menial tasks</p>
        <!-- What is the Impact -->
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is the likely impact of cloud computing?</h3>
        <p>Cloud computing is impacting everyone's lives daily whether they realize it or not. In today’s world it’s almost a necessity to make use of the technology whether that's for personal reasons or as a business; This makes cloud technology one of the most impactful industries in today’s market with “90% of companies utilizing the cloud, 60% of workloads being run on the cloud and 30% of IT budgets being dedicated to the cloud”(Flexera 2019). Generating an estimated $US249,800,000,000 in revenue a year with those numbers only expected to increase in the coming years.</p>
        <p>With more businesses adopting the use of cloud computing the technology itself continues to evolve allowing it to expand into a wider range of uses, For example a technology many companies are now aiming to perfect is Gaming as a service(GaaS) with the gaming market predicted to make an estimated $US256.97 billion in revenue by the year 2025 (Mordor Intelligence 2019). Many businesses see this as an opportunity to generate profits via using cloud technology to run video games, requiring no expensive hardware to be purchased on the users end, they can simply install applications on their platform of choice (usually smartphones or computers) and be able to play the most current games with minimal requirements. For example, services like google stadia or PlayStation now currently allow users to play video games over the cloud. Among this I believe that cloud technology will heavily impact startups and small business with more business adopting the Desktop as a Service (DaaS) model which allows companies to utilize the cloud to deliver virtual desktops or virtual machines (VM) which can be accessed via a html browser or downloaded to a device for instance, desktops, laptops or tablets can make use of DaaS. The use of DaaS offers a pay-as-you-go and allows the business to scale up without the hefty costs involved with purchasing computer hardware outright. As Cloud computing evolves, I believe the impact it will have on the information technology industry and other businesses alike, will see the industry spend less money on hardware components and more spent implementing the cloud into their workspaces. </p>
        <!-- The affect -->
        <h3 class="heading-md">How will this affect you?</h3>
        <p>Cloud computing will affect me in many ways throughout my personal life and my career. In my personal life the cloud affects me daily making use of Google's platforms such as, storing my documents and photos via google drive, creating new documents with google docs and google sheets and sending and receiving emails via Gmail. Cloud computing will also certainly affect me as someone who enjoys playing video games as the Gaming as a service (GaaS) technology evolves it will create opportunities for me to experience video games in a completely new way, being able to play games on the go with mobile devices or laptops without the need for expensive hardware to make that possible.</p>
        <p>In my professional career cloud computing will also affect me in many ways; as someone who has the goal of working as a software engineer, I believe that I will be making use of the cloud on almost a daily basis. Whether that may be storing and accessing data on the cloud, using email to communicate with colleagues or using different cloud service models to create and deploy apps. Useful models like PaaS to create applications on the cloud (e.g. google app engine) and utilizing a BaaS (backend as a Service) method to manage the behind the scenes aspects involved with app development.</p>
