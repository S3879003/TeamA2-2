            <!-- what it is -->
            <h3 class="heading-md">What is the Cloud?</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud technology enables the user or users to store and access data, and access programs via the
                internet. Instead of using a computer's local hard drive space, users can always store their data and
                applications on the cloud to be readily accessible. Companies or users alike can rent programs or
                storage from cloud service providers, for companies this can reduce the heavy upfront costs involved
                with owning and maintaining their own IT data infrastructure. Instead they are able to pay for what they
                use and when they use it. The cloud service providers own large data centers which contain a massive
                amount of computer systems and networking equipment; These are used for storing, collecting, processing,
                distributing or allowing access to massive amounts of data. When clients are deciding to move to cloud
                services for their business there are multiple different models available to choose from. The main three
                cloud service models include:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-container-sml">
                <li>SaaS SaaS (software as a service).</li>
                <li>IaaS (infrastructure as a service).</li>
                <li>PaaS (platform as a service).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Each of these individual cloud service models have their own unique benefits to fit the needs that
                different types of businesses and operations require.
            </p>
            <!-- SaaS information -->
            <h3 class="heading-sml">What is SaaS and when to use it</h3>
            <p>Software as a service, commonly shortened to SaaS, is the most commonly utilized cloud model taking
                advantage of the internet to deliver applications to their users. Most of the SaaS applications usually
                run directly through the user's browser; this is quite useful because it requires no downloads and
                installation by the end user. Commonly used SaaS services include google cloud, dropbox and Microsoft
                365.
            </p>
            <p>
                SaaS platforms are best suited for when you would like your applications to run reliably and without any
                hiccups with minimal input from the user. For example, emailing is a good use of SaaS as businesses and
                individuals alike greatly benefit from being able to send and receive emails without having to worry
                about needing to update or mess with settings. For instance, if you had an email server for your
                business, and it went down because it wasn’t updated correctly it could go down for several days until
                someone came out and fixed it. This could seriously affect the business and is just not an option
                businesses need to be taking in today's market.
            </p>
            <!-- IaaS information -->
            <h3 class="heading-sml">What is IaaS?</h3>
            <p>
                Infrastructure as a service, commonly shortened to IaaS, allows companies to rent a provision of a
                computer's hardware resources over the internet instead of having to purchase the hardware outright.
                IaaS cloud providers can give companies access to a wide array of infrastructures including, storage,
                networking, servers and other services. Examples of IaaS providers include, Digital Ocean, Amazon web
                services, and Microsoft azure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Infrastructure as a service can be useful to many different types and sizes of businesses; It allows the
                business to have complete control over the infrastructure and works on a pay-as-you-use model which
                allows the service to fit into most budgets. IaaS is great for scaling as it allows you to expand to
                meet your requirements at any time, allowing companies to essentially future proof themselves.
            </p>
            <!-- PaaS Information -->
            <h3 class="heading-sml">What is PaaS?</h3>
            <p>
                Platform as a service, commonly shortened to PaaS, allows developers to rent the tools they need to
                create and deploy applications all completely on the cloud without having to build and maintain the
                complex infrastructure that would normally be involved with building and deploying applications. Common
                examples of PaaS providers include Google App Engine, AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Heroku.
            </p>
            <p>
                Platform as a service is most often the most time efficient and cost-effective way for developers to
                create applications. PaaS enables the developers to spend more time focused on the creative side of
                developing apps instead of wasting time on software updates or other menial tasks.
            </p>
            <!-- What is the Impact -->
            <h3 class="heading-md">What is the likely impact of cloud computing?</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud computing is impacting everyone's lives daily whether they realize it or not. In today’s world it’s
                almost a necessity to make use of the technology whether that's for personal reasons or as a business;
                This makes cloud technology one of the most impactful industries in today’s market with “90% of
                companies utilizing the cloud, 60% of workloads being run on the cloud and 30% of IT budgets being
                dedicated to the cloud”(Flexera 2019). Generating an estimated $US249,800,000,000 in revenue a year with
                those numbers only expected to increase in the coming years.
            </p>
            <p>
                With more businesses adopting the use of cloud computing the technology itself continues to evolve
                allowing it to expand into a wider range of uses, For example a technology many companies are now aiming
                to perfect is Gaming as a service(GaaS) with the gaming market predicted to make an estimated $US256.97
                billion in revenue by the year 2025 (Mordor Intelligence 2019). Many businesses see this as an
                opportunity to generate profits via using cloud technology to run video games, requiring no expensive
                hardware to be purchased on the users end, they can simply install applications on their platform of
                choice (usually smartphones or computers) and be able to play the most current games with minimal
                requirements. For example, services like google stadia or PlayStation now currently allow users to play
                video games over the cloud. Among this I believe that cloud technology will heavily impact startups and
                small business with more business adopting the Desktop as a Service (DaaS) model which allows companies
                to utilize the cloud to deliver virtual desktops or virtual machines (VM) which can be accessed via a
                html browser or downloaded to a device for instance, desktops, laptops or tablets can make use of DaaS.
                The use of DaaS offers a pay-as-you-go and allows the business to scale up without the hefty costs
                involved with purchasing computer hardware outright. As Cloud computing evolves, I believe the impact it
                will have on the information technology industry and other businesses alike, will see the industry spend
                less money on hardware components and more spent implementing the cloud into their workspaces.
            </p>
            <!-- The affect -->
            <h3 class="heading-md">How will this affect you?</h3>
            <p>
                Cloud computing will affect me in many ways throughout my personal life and my career. In my personal
                life the cloud affects me daily making use of Google's platforms such as, storing my documents and
                photos via google drive, creating new documents with google docs and google sheets and sending and
                receiving emails via Gmail. Cloud computing will also certainly affect me as someone who enjoys playing
                video games as the Gaming as a service (GaaS) technology evolves it will create opportunities for me to
                experience video games in a completely new way, being able to play games on the go with mobile devices
                or laptops without the need for expensive hardware to make that possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my professional career cloud computing will also affect me in many ways; as someone who has the goal
                of working as a software engineer, I believe that I will be making use of the cloud on almost a daily
                basis. Whether that may be storing and accessing data on the cloud, using email to communicate with
                colleagues or using different cloud service models to create and deploy apps. Useful models like PaaS to
                create applications on the cloud (e.g. google app engine) and utilizing a BaaS (backend as a Service)
                method to manage the behind the scenes aspects involved with app development.

        <h2 class="heading-lg text-center">Report on Cyber Security</h2>
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is Cyber Security?</h3>
        <p>
            Cyber Security is the procedure of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks by
            combining a body of technologies, processes, and practices. There are numerous elements that encompass
            cyber:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Network Security: The process of protecting a network from threats, unwanted access, and intrusions.
            <li>Application Security: Ensuring programs are safe from attacks via updates and testing.
            <li>Endpoint Security: Companies that use remote access need to protect their network in the process.
            <li>Data Security: Business contain and keep valuable information for both themselves and customers in
                networks and applications. It is of upmost importance to keep this data safe.
            <li>Identity Management: The understanding of the level of access each individual is granted in an
                organisation.
            <li>Database and Infrastructure Security: Using the necessary tools to protect the databases and physical
                equipment of the network.
            <li>Cloud Security: Protecting the data that is stored in a complete online environment.
            <li>Mobile Security: Specifically referring to mobile phones and tablets, which can be any number of these
                different elements combined.
            <li>Disaster Recovery: This is the plan in place for the continuity of the business in the event of a data
                breach, natural disaster, or another event where data is in risk.
        </ul>
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is the state of the art of Cyber Security?</h3>
        <p>
            In today’s day and age, IT is continuously evolving and in turn so are cyber threats and security risks. With
            the advancement of technology, organisations have had to shift from the traditional ways of protecting
            against perimeter threats to a more continuous, proactive, and adaptive approach to counteract the level and
            severity of cyber threats.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Every year, organisations lose billions of pounds to cybercrime – and it’s a persistent and worsening
            problem.” [Victor Victories, 2020].
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to the worsening problem of cybercrime, the cyber-defence industry has had to look for new ways to combat
            these threats. The continuous search to find more effective means has resulted in some ground-breaking
            defence technologies:
        </p>
        <h3 class="heading-sml">
            Moving Target Security
        </h3>
        <p>An Israeli company by the name of Morphisec has developed a method of cyber defence which effectively
            scrambles details to prevent and deter malware from infecting a system. This is done by scrambling the
            names, references, locations of files, as well as the application itself in the server’s memory. On top of
            this, whenever the computer is booted up the details are re-scrambled once again, ensuring the system does
            not repeat the same configuration. [6]</p>
        <h3 class="heading-sml">
            Air Gapping
        </h3>
        <p>Air gapping is a technique in which a system is isolated from local networks and the internet. When a system
            is air gapped, the only way it can be compromised from hacking is by physical access to the server itself.
            This is an effective method of security for highly sensitive data and critical systems. However, even though
            it is a good countermeasure against outside threats, there are still potential security issues such as air
            gapped servers being altered or modified prior to installation. [7]</p>
        <h3 class="heading-sml">
            Cooperative Cybersecurity
        </h3>
        <p>As organisations grow larger, their data becomes more valuable. In turn, to protect their data they can form
            a data-sharing alliance to store each other’s data. As data is encoded into thousands of numbers, this
            method effectively disperses them randomly to the computers within the participating organisations. As this
            data is encrypted, for a hacker to steal this data they would need to not only hack one organization, but
            all of them collectively. Not only this, but they would also need to unencrypt the data itself. [8]
        <h3 class="heading-sml">
            Next-Gen Firewalls
        </h3>
        <p>Currently, all computers have in-built firewalls to protect their data. Firewalls are an effective method of
            data security if they are built well. A company by the name of Fortinet have built FortiGate, a next-gen
            firewall to protect websites and web apps from virus, ransomware, and malware infections all the while
            preventing intrusions from cyber threats and blocking distributed denial of service attacks. This next-gen
            firewall is designed to keep the most critical applications secure. To do this, the FortiGate’s threat
            intelligence is continuously updated in order to provide vigorous protection from attacks. [9]</p>
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is the likely impact?</h3>
        <p>In the coming years it may be possible to create a computer that is so well protected that it becomes
            un-hackable, however the process of doing so would render it almost useless in a network environment. No
            matter the protection, there will always be a risk involved when using a network. Security companies are
            continuously looking at new and more sophisticated ways to protect data from cyber threats. As the age of IT
            continues to grow and develop, as does the methods of protection but in turn so does the tools of
            cyber-attacks. Cybercriminals are now using tools such as artificial intelligence, and processes of hiding
            malicious code in encrypted files. Having a safe network and computer whether at work or at home is becoming
            harder every day. [12]</p>
        <p>As it stands, our society fundamentally is more technologically reliant than ever, and there is no clear
            indicator of when this trend will slow. Social media websites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have our
            information mostly publicly available; information that could be maliciously used for identity theft. Cloud
            storage services such as Dropbox, Google Drive and OneDrive store sensitive and valuable data like credit
            card information and bank account details.</p>
        <p>Since our society is on a path to technological advancement, the increased use of technology and the internet
            also lead to the increase in cybercrime. With the data that we store online, cybercriminals are becoming
            more sophisticated with increase in attacks with ransomware, phishing, and spyware.</p>
        <h3 class="heading-md">How will this affect you?</h3>
        <p>The development in cyber-security technologies will be most beneficial for organisations, as they contain the
            most valuable data. When it comes to computers used for personal use in day-to-day life, a more personalized
            approach needs to be developed. Most households will not have access to next-gen cyber security
            technologies.</p>
        <p>According to Statisa 4.57 billion people were active internet users as of July 2020, encompassing 59 percent
            of the human population. More than half of the planet use internet in their day-to-day lives. Of those 4.57
            billion people, 2.6 billion use Facebook; that is a third of the human population who make their information
            publicly available. There have been countless data breaches where the information of consumers has been
            obtained by cybercriminals, information such as phone numbers, passwords, e-mail addresses, IP addresses,
            names, dates of birth, bank details, and credit card information. Even with the advancements in
            cyber-security, these breaches do and will continue to happen. [13] [14]</p>
        <p>Cyber-defence industry is continuously evolving to combat these threats. As technology becomes more important
            and integrated in our lives, it leads us to become increasingly dependent on it. It certainly makes life
            easier, but also allows vulnerabilities to risk. As breaches in cyber-security can be catastrophic for not
            only organisations but also individuals, these advancements will put safeguards in place to protect our
            wealth, health, and livelihood. This will help the population become more aware of cyber threats, and how to
            defend themselves. Another benefit to the improvements of cyber-security is that it embeds awareness
            training and risk mitigation into our everyday lives. Awareness and risk mitigation coupled with advanced
            cyber-security will result in a safe online environment and the gradual decrease in cybercrime.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-lg text-center">Machine Learning </h2>
        <h3 class="heading-md">What is Machine learning?</h3>
        <p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence which is aimed to be able to learn itself from inputted data and predict outcomes without being programmed by a human. Traditionally, humans analyzed data and adapted the system to the changes in data patterns. However, as the larger volume of data surpasses the ability of humans to make sense of it and write rules manually, humans have turned to automated systems that can learn from the data and more importantly, adapt to the changes in data to provide a comprehensible result. IT professionals like software engineers are inclined to think logically and mathematically when it comes to determining an outcome of a certain event or a program, with machine learning, the method shifts from a mathematical science to natural science: making observations of an unpredictable world, running experiments and analyzing statistics to determine a conclusion (Norvig, 2020).</p>
        <p>There are two types of learning techniques that Machine learning uses: supervised learning, which trains a model on labeled data, in other words, known input and output data, and uses it to predict future outputs. The second is unsupervised learning, which finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data (au.mathworks.com, 2020).</p>
        <p>Machine learning is implemented in numerous areas, here are a few examples of what it is currently being used for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Virtual Personal Assistants:
              <br>Whether it be Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, or even Bixby, all these virtual assistants use machine learning as they collect and analyze the information based on your previous interaction with them. Later, this set of data is used to extract outcomes that are personalized to your preferences.</br>
            <li>Product Recommendations:
              <br>When someone searches for a product or service online, they start receiving emails and social media advertisements for the same product or similar items which may be of interest to the customer. This is the work of machine learning as it advertises similar product recommendations based on your web browsing behavior, past purchases, and in general things that a user may have clicked on or added to cart.</br>
            <li>Fraud Detection:
              <br>Many organizations use rule-based systems to detect fraud. Rule-based systems can quickly and accurately notice known patterns. However, rules are not at all effective at recognizing unknown schemes, learning new fraud patterns, or managing sophisticated techniques used by fraudsters. Here, fraud analytics, powered by machine learning, becomes necessary for fraud prevention and detection (SAS.com, 2020).
            </br>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="heading-md">What is State-of-the-art in Machine Learning?</h3>
        <p>Machine learning’s latest and most compelling developments are seen in the healthcare system. From the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases to the development of medication and epidemiology, Machine learning has significant potential to revolutionize the medical industry. The increase in knowledge and understanding of diseases has led to the growth in information and data. Such a big data bank is now be being used for the application of machine learning. An example of this is Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), Machine learning in CMR can assist clinicians and engineers in improving imaging quality, image analysis, and interpretation, as well as patient evaluation. This is done by extracting important characteristics or features from images by using a designed feature set. In this case, features may include image contrast, noise characteristics, texture, and motion. In the training phase, the parameters of the feature set model are learned. A model is any function of the features used for prediction and the parameters of the model dictate the actual predictions made. Once trained, the model can be used to predict data not seen previously in the training phase. ML models can then predict the presence or absence of disease (Leiner, T., Rueckert, D., Suinesiaputra, A, 2019).
        </p>
          <h3 class="heading-md">Future of Machine learning:</h3>
          <p>Today there exists supervised Machine learning in which labels need to be provided for the machine to learn, however going into the future it is much more likely that only unsupervised algorithms will exist and produce much more accurate results. Neural networks (replicating the process of real neurons in our brain) are fundamental for breakthroughs in machine learning, this is called Deep Learning. A future application of Machine learning and its subset Deep learning is currently being developed by companies like Apple, Tesla, and Nissan in the form of Autonomous cars or self-driving vehicles. One of the main tasks of the machine learning algorithm in the self-driving car is a continuous rendering of the surrounding environment and the prediction of possible changes to those surroundings. These tasks are mainly divided into four sub-tasks, object detection, object Identification, object localization, and prediction of movement (MQTT et al., 2020).</p>
          <h3 class="heading-md">Impact of Machine learning:</h3>
          <p>Machine learning systems are growing more popular and better with experience. Just as electricity and steam engines had transformed the world, machine learning systems are poised to do the same. They can do numerous amounts of tasks much more effectively and efficiently than humans; they can also detect many complex observations that seem invisible to the human mind. However, they are unlikely to replace people in all jobs. Earlier this year, for instance, researchers showed that a Machine learning program could detect skin cancers better than a dermatologist. That doesn’t mean it will replace dermatologists, who do many things other than evaluate lesions. For tasks that are already online, Machine learning can be immensely productive. Jobs that don’t require dexterity, physical skills, or mobility are much more suitable for Machine learning. Tasks that involve making quick decisions based on data is what Machine learning programs are designed for; not so if the decision depends on long chains of reasoning, diverse background knowledge, or common sense. Machine learning is not suitable for detailed explanations and reasoning behind how a decision was made. For instance, Machine learning might be producing a more accurate result and faster than a physician at detecting skin cancers, but a dermatologist is better at explaining why a lesion is cancerous or not (sciencedaily.com, 2020). It may be very evident that technologies like Machine learning and Artificial intelligence are replacing the human workforce such as Google, who in 2014 Google was valued at $370 billion with only 55,000 employees, a tenth the size of AT&T’s workforce in the 1960s, yet workers will have to perform new tasks or be reskilled as tasks become automated, leading to millions of new jobs. As businesses embrace AI, robots, machine learning, and deep learning, they will need a clear strategy for using technology without creating fear around the displacement of jobs.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-md">How does Machine learning impact you?</h3>
          <p>There are countless ways in which Machine learning is being implemented and used throughout our lives. Of course, there are common and well-known methods such as the ones I listed above like virtual personal assistants, personalized marketing, and fraud detection, but there are still many more that have more impact on our lives than we realize.</p>
          <p><br><b>Intelligent Gaming:</b></br>
            Google's DeepMind's AlphaGo defeated Go world champion, Lee Sedol. Go is a much more difficult game to master than Chess, however, AlphaGo was specifically trained to play Go, not only by replicating moves of the best players but more so by learning to play better from practicing against itself millions of times (elitedatascience.com,2020). Just like this example Machine learning is used in many games to create complex and difficult opposing AI bots to enhance a gamer’s experience.
          </p>
          <p><br><b>Personalized Digital Media:</b></br>
            Machine learning is heavily used in the entertainment industry. Streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play, and Spotify. Algorithms are also used to remove buffering and low-quality playback, getting users the best quality regardless of the internet service provider. Machine learning algorithms record and store vast amounts of data about consumers’ viewing habits, helping streaming services offer more useful recommendations (elitedatascience.com,2020).
          </p>
          <p>"Given the rapid pace of research, I expect AI to be able to create new personalized media, such as music according to your taste. Imagine a future music service that doesn't just play existing songs you might like, but continually generates new songs just for you."
          <br>— Jan Kautz, Senior Director of Visual Computing and Machine Learning Research, NVIDIA</br>
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-md">Conclusion:</h3>
          <p>Since the earliest days of computing, Artificial intelligence has been implemented and developed. Pioneers always want to make machines smarter and more intelligent as time goes on and we discover extraordinary technologies. Machine learning is currently the most promising aspect of Artificial Intelligence. Instead of encoding machines with everything task, they must perform and carry out, Machine learning enables them to learn, and then to learn again on how to learn, this is the fundamental process which is revolutionizing all of our lives.
