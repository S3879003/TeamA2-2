    <h2 class="heading-sml">What went well?</h2>
        <p>The group was able to delegate tasks quickly and efficiently. No one had any problems with the tasks they were given and completed them in a timely manner. </p>
    <h2 class="heading-sml">What could be improved? </h2>
        <p>Using the chat in Teams efficiently. Quite a few times we went off topic. Next time we should perhaps create two separate chats, one for on topic discussions and another for general talk. </p>
    <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that was surprising? </h2>
        <p>The most surprising thing would have to be how well we got along. We have a quite diverse group with people from multiple backgrounds, yet everyone was able to work as a team despite the age differences and cultural differences. </p>
    <h2 class="heading-sml">At least one thing that you have learned about groups? </h2>
        <p>Iâ€™ve learnt how we as a group can utilize all our different skills and combine our efforts to produce a great result. </p>

    <h2 class="heading-sml">Github Activity? </h2>
        <p>Our Github log of activity was a great effort for a first try. Personally, my activity looked like it is a bit all over the place since I was still getting used to using Github and forking/merging. However as a team I believe we did quite well in keeping track all of the changes committed and recording them effectively. </p>
