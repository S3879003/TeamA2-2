    <h3 class="text-center heading-lg">Has your opinion on ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h3>
<p>After a discussion with the group, most of our chosen ideal jobs have not changed except for Andrew who advised he would aim for a higher position of Computer Scientist. Andrew picked Computer Scientist as it is a more developed job title than his previous ideal job of Software Developer. Andrew wants to use ‘Software Developer’ as a stepping stone to reach his higher goal of ‘Computer Scientist’. Andrew did also advise that rankings did not affect his choice as it is constantly changing and ever evolving.

<p>The rest of the group however have come to agree that their chosen jobs are what they are passionate about, and their opinions have not changed after looking through the Burning Glass data. Regardless of ranking, availability or demand from employers, it is a personal goal they want to achieve and it is the job they would like to do in the future. In the future, it is likely that the chosen ideal jobs will change depending on the person. However demand from employers will also likely change as the world continues to grow and develop into the future IT-age.  

<p>With these rankings, often comes another important point: salary. The higher the ranking a job is, the higher the salary the company will offer for it. It is logical to assume that when demand is high, so is the rewards. However as discussed with the group, even though the higher-ranking jobs would more than likely have higher salaries, passion comes first. If a person doesn’t enjoy what they are doing, then no amount of money will be enough to satisfy them.
