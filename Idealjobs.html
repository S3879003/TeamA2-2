     If you have come to this page you’ve already met our team and read a little about each of us.<br>
     Here we are comparing and contrasting of each team members ideal jobs.<br>
     In general, our ideal jobs were all very similar. Software engineer/developer was the direction that<br>
     most of the group wanted to head with their careers with the exemption of one military job being cyber analyst.<br>
     We all planned to be working in large organisations but ones with very different services and platforms.<br>
     The largest differences in our ideals would have to be the geographic locations of each.<br>
