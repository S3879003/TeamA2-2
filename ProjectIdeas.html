            <h1 class="heading-lg text-center">Project idea: Find A Teacher</h1>

            <h2 class="heading-md text-center">Overview: </h2>

            <p>Find A Teacher is an application for freelance teachers and students. It will be an app that is designed to help people find someone willing to teach a subject that they are passionate about (e.g. learning piano). The App offers the users two different ways to learn; the first option would be meeting with the chosen teacher in real life and the second option would be using the app to perform a video call session. Making use of location services, the app would help students find teachers within their area of choice or within a suitable time zone for video sessions to be conducted. The students will be able to organize times that suit them best for a lesson, and chat with their teachers via the app if they have any questions or concerns between lessons. Payments for lessons will all be handled securely within the app.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-md text-center">Similar apps: </h2>

            <h3 class="heading-sml">Fiverr: </h3>

           <p>Fiverr has some similarities to Find A Teacher in the way that people offer lessons through the app, although fiverr works as more of a freelancer landscape and provides a purely online experience. Fiverr works by allowing “sellers” to sell their services for a fee of their choosing and then the “buyers” buy their service for said fee (fiverr, 2020). After the purchase of the service it is the seller's responsibility to conduct the video lesson with this student as there is no built-in video chat feature. This works slightly differently to Find A Teacher as Find A Teacher is tailored more towards connecting users with teachers in a setting that allows online sessions through the app but also in-person sessions. </p> 

           <h3 class="heading-sml">Udemy: </h3>

            <p>
               Udemy works as a platform for instructors to sell pre-recorded courses, as well as including additional resources and practice activities (Udemy, 2020).
            </p>

            <p>
                Udemy is like Find A Teacher in that it allows freelance teachers to teach subjects they are passionate about. However, Udemy works as a platform for the instructors to sell video recorded course content whereas Find A Teacher is a more personal 1:1 experience, allowing for the benefit of in-person interaction.
            </p> 

            <h3 class="heading-md text-center">Planned Features: </h3>

            <p>
                There are many features that are planned to be implemented in the successful completion of this app. These include:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-container">
                <li>
                    <b>Online bookings</b> - This feature will make it easier for students to organize a booking without having to try and contact anyone by phone call.
                </li> 

                <li>
                    <b>Location services</b> - Location services will be used to help students find teachers in their local area, mainly used to conduct in-person sessions.
                </li> 

                <li>
                    <b>In-app payments</b> - The in-app payments will be used for the security of all users and as a revenue stream from the application.
                </li> 

                <li>
                    <b>Instant messaging</b> - Instant messaging will be used to allow teachers and students to chat to each other between lessons.
                </li> 

                <li>
                    <b>Forums</b> - The website version of the application would include access to forums, allowing users to post questions and talk to other students doing similar subjects.
                </li> 

                <li>
                    <b>Map listings</b> - This feature will display the teacher's locations via a map interface, showing different “pins” on the map for users to click on and display information about the said teacher.
                </li> 
            </ul> 

            <h3 class="heading-md text-center">Motivation: </h3>

            <p>
                The motivation behind wanting to build this app is to help students and teachers alike. The goal is to improve the education and life skills of students around the globe. The app will make it easier for people to locate a teacher as they will not have to sift through different websites, reviews, apps and other outlets for the perfect match to their learning needs. Instead, this app will consolidate all teachers into one platform, making life easier for everyone involved. The main goal will be to help keep students on track and to achieve their goals, whatever they may be.
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-md text-center">Description: </h3>

           <p>
               Find A Teacher is an application that will be available for use on windows, mac, android and iPhone via the internet or free downloadable app. The app works by allowing people who want to teach something to drop a pin on the map based roughly around their location and they’ll be able to include the subjects they wish to teach others, such as musical instruments, a foreign language, cooking etc. The teachers will also be required to write a description about their service, which would include how long they’ve been teaching, a video showcasing their skills (optional), times they are available and how much they are charging per lesson. The teachers can also apply for verified status; this status would verify that the teacher has formal training/experience in the subject they are teaching.
            </p> 

            

           <p>
               The students upon account creation are asked questions about what subject/skills they are interested in and are automatically shown some potential teachers, however, the students are still able to use a search bar and location services to find different teachers. After the students have selected the teacher they wish to go with, the student will then be able to see a timetable of the available times and dates. The student will then select when and how long of a session they wish to do, and the teacher will receive a notification asking them to confirm whether they accept the lesson. Once confirmed, the student will be sent, via the app and/or email, a confirmation that the lesson was accepted which will include all relevant information. If the lesson is declined the student will then be given the option to either refund or book the lesson for a different time.
            </p>

           <p>
               Students will also be allowed to leave detailed reviews of the teachers. For instance, a star rating from 1 to 5 and a description of what the teaching experience was like. To give an example, someone could leave a review that says, “I had an excellent time learning guitar from John; he was experienced, very patient with me and really helped me move in the right direction”.
            </p> 

           <p>
               The app would offer two different ways to teach with in-person sessions and video sessions a possibility, one can connect with their teacher no matter where they are in the world. With the option to send the teacher questions via in app messaging, the app will allow users to keep connected between lessons. There are also forums available via the website for users to post questions, seek help and talk to other like-minded individuals learning the same subjects. Thus, if a person's teacher isn’t available, they will still be able to seek advice.
            </p>  

           <p>
               The safety of the students and teachers would be a very important aspect of this app. Several features would be included to ensure safety when visiting teachers' homes or workplaces. These include:
            </p>
 
            <ul  class="list-container">
                <li>Upon the teachers creating their postings, the exact address of the teachers would not be revealed until they’ve accepted the lesson with that user. </li> 

                <li>The app would log the location of the student (upon their approval), in case of strict emergency uses there would be a history of where they have been. </li> 
            </ul>

            <h2 class="heading-md text-center">Tools and Technologies: </h2>

            <h3 class="heading-sml">Student/teachers: </h3>

           <p>
               The Tools and technologies required from the student/teacher perspective to be able to use the app would be the need of either an android, iPhone, compatible tablet or computer. Access to the internet and the use of a web browser would also be required. If the student or teacher is conducting an online lesson access to a webcam and audio would generally be required by both teacher and student.
            </p> 

           <h3 class="heading-sml">Tools required for both mobile and website: </h3>

           <p>
               The tools and technologies required of the programmer/s to create this app/website include access to devices which they are able to test the application on including access to smartphones or ability to install iOS/android emulators, access to a web browser and use of a webcam. Other tools and technologies required would include a cross platform development tool, access to a code editor, google maps api and Firebase, a backend as a service (BaaS) provider.
            </p>

           <h3 class="heading-sml">Tools required for mobile version: </h3> 

            <p>
                To create the mobile version of the app, we would require a cross platform development tool, for example flutter. Using a development tool like flutter would greatly speed up the development time by allowing a version for android and a version for iPhone to be created simultaneously (flutter, 2020).
            </p>  

            <h3 class="heading-sml">Tools required for website version:  </h3>

            <p>
                To create the website version of the app, we would require a text editor (for example, visual studio code) and use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. A web hosting service would also be required to host the website, some of the most popular options are Bluehost, dream host and HostGator (Lofgren, L., 2020.).
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-sml">Skills required: </h3>

            <p>
               Outlined below are the necessary skills required to build the app in an efficient yet secure way, ensuring that the user's information is protected from cybersecurity threats.
            </p>  

            <h3 class="heading-sml">Both mobile and website versions: </h3>

            <p>
               Both versions of the project idea would require a secure backend, which would be safe from crashes, cybersecurity threats and is easily scalable as the user base grows. To streamline the development time and security of the app we believe that a BaaS (backend as a service) model would be a useful tool; we believe the best two options would be either firebase or AWS Amplify.
            </p> 

            <h3 class="heading-sml"> Mobile version: </h3>

            <p>
                To create this app easily and smoothly, we believe a cross platform app development tool would be required. There are many options for this such as Xamarin, react native, phone gap and ionic. We believe the best platform would be flutter for several reasons including: 
            </p>

            <ul class="list-container">
                <li>
                    Using flutter reduces time and money spent developing an app by quickly looking native on both android and iOS (flutter,2020). 
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Uses the programming language dart, which is an easy language for developers to learn (flutter,2020). 
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Access to native features such as camera, which is required for phone sessions (flutter,2020). 
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Flutter also has the flutter app builder, which allows you to design the UI of your app for free in a browser (flutter,2020). 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="heading-sml"> Website version: </h3>

            <p>
                The website version would require an extensive knowledge of HTML, CSS and a JavaScript framework such as react or angular to streamline development time. 
            </p>

            
            

            <h2 class="heading-md text-center">
                Delivery of Find A Teacher: 
            </h2>

            <p>
                The Team has planned to implement several features upon the completion of assessment three, with each of these items creating significant footwork towards the future completion of the app. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-sml">
                App UI:
            </h3> 

            <p>
                The first of these components is creating a user interface mock-up for the application. There are a few options for this such as Flutter Studio an online tool used to create mock-ups for flutter-based apps or Adobe photoshop. Photoshop can be used to create the mock-up in greater detail. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="heading-sml">
                Website:
            </h3> 

            <p>
                The website component will include early stages of information about the project. This would include information such as:
            </p>

            <ul  class="list-container-sml">
                <li>
                    Information about the app (for example, what it does, why it was created, the team behind it, who it benefits etc.).
                </li> 
    
                <li>
                    Examples of how the app is used (e.g. How its used on different devices, how students or teachers can make use of it etc.). 
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Examples of the designs interface (e.g. Images of what the UI looks like on mobile devices, how the UI looks like on computers etc. ). 
                </li>
    
                <li>
                    Sign up via email to be alearted once the app is compeleted. 
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="heading-lg">
                Outcome:
            </h2> 

            <p>
                On successful completion of this app, students around the globe will be able to take their education to new heights- learning many valuable skills and subjects.  The app would make it easier to find a teacher by creating an all-encompassing platform for all freelance teachers to use; instead of students searching through multiple websites, reviews, specialized apps or going around asking people they know. This app puts it all in one place to help increase the student's chance of success in their learning endeavors.
